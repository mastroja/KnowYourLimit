# KnowYourLimit

The goal of this app is to allow users to track the number of alcoholic drinks they have had and report their level of intoxication.

The app will have 3 categories of drinks (Beer, Liquor, and Mixed Drinks) Each with values (Name, Category, ABV, and Size). We will store a few drinks in each category for user to choose from. The hope is users will also be able to add new drinks (this feature is not extremely important to the overall functionality)
